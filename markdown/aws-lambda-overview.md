# AWS Lambda Overview
## What is AWS Lambda?
AWS Lambda allows you to run code for virtually any type of application or backend service with zero administration. You simply upload your code and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability.

## Key Concepts
* Event-driven: You can set up your code to automatically trigger from other AWS services or call it directly from any web or mobile app.
* Serverless: There is no need to provision or manage servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume - there's no charge when your code isn't running.

## Core Features
* Automatic Scaling: Automatically scales your application by running code in response to each trigger. Your code runs in parallel and processes each trigger individually, scaling precisely with the size of the workload.
* Subsecond Metering: You're charged for every 1 millisecond your code executes and the number of times your code is triggered. This pricing model makes it cost-effective and scalable.
* Languages Supported: Supports multiple programming languages including Node.js, Python, Ruby, Java, Go, .NET, and custom runtimes that implement the Lambda Runtime API.

## Use Cases
* Web Applications: Build serverless web applications that automatically scale, from simple websites to complex, dynamically rendered, interactive sites.
* Real-time File Processing: Automatically process files as they are uploaded to Amazon S3 by running a Lambda function to process data (e.g., image, video conversion).
* Real-time Stream Processing: Use Lambda to process data streams in real time with Amazon Kinesis or Kafka.
* Machine Learning: Run inference using pre-trained models in response to user requests or incoming events.
* Automated Tasks/Backends: Perform workloads triggered by AWS services like AWS S3 events or changes in database state.

## Deployment and Operation
* Triggers: Functions can be triggered by specific AWS service events (like S3 bucket changes), HTTP requests via Amazon API Gateway, direct AWS SDK invocations from any application, and more.
* Versioning and Aliases: Lambda supports versioning and aliases so developers can easily manage, test, and roll back functions to different versions.

## Security
* IAM Roles: Lambda functions use AWS IAM roles to securely operate with access to other AWS services.
* VPC Support: Functions can be configured to access resources within a VPC, securing and tailoring access to databases, caches, and internal services.
Monitoring and Logging
* AWS CloudWatch: Integrates with CloudWatch for logging and monitoring, providing insights into execution metrics such as function invocations, durations, and errors.
* X-Ray Integration: Offers insights into the behavior of your Lambda functions for better understanding of performance bottlenecks and dependencies.

## Best Practices
* Keep Functions Lean: The leaner your function, the quicker the execution. Organize your deployment package to include only necessary code and dependencies.
* Minimize Permissions: Apply the principle of least privilege by granting your Lambda functions only the permissions they need.
* Optimize Execution Time: Monitor and optimize the execution time of your functions, especially if they are part of a larger, user-facing workflow.

## AWS Lambda Pricing:
* Pay-per-Request: $0.20 per 1 million requests after the first free 1 million requests monthly.
* Compute Time: Priced per 100 milliseconds of execution, scaled by the amount of memory allocated.
* Free Tier: Includes 1 million requests and 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time monthly, free.
* Additional Costs: Charges for using other AWS services and data transfer may apply.
